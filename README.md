# Scalp Trading Indicator with MA and EMA

This code is a custom indicator for scalp trading in the Forex market. It uses Moving Average (MA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to identify potential trade opportunities. The indicator calculates and displays three lines on the chart: SMA10 (Simple Moving Average with a 10-period), SMA21 (Simple Moving Average with a 21-period), and EMA200 (Exponential Moving Average with a 200-period).

## Indicator Settings

- `MA10_Period`: The period for calculating the SMA10 line (default: 10)
- `MA21_Period`: The period for calculating the SMA21 line (default: 21)
- `EMA200_Period`: The period for calculating the EMA200 line (default: 200)

## Indicator Initialization

The indicator initializes by setting up the indicator buffers and labels for the three lines. It also defines the styles and parameters for drawing the lines on the chart.

## Indicator Calculation

The indicator calculates the values for the three lines based on the input parameters and the price data. It uses the `iMA` function to calculate the moving averages for each period and assigns the values to the corresponding indicator buffers.

## Product Description

The Scalp Trading Indicator with MA and EMA is a powerful tool for traders who prefer short-term trading strategies. It helps identify potential entry and exit points based on the moving averages. The indicator displays three lines on the chart: SMA10, SMA21, and EMA200. Traders can use these lines to determine the overall trend and make informed trading decisions.

The SMA10 line represents the short-term trend, SMA21 represents the medium-term trend, and EMA200 represents the long-term trend. When the short-term trend crosses above the medium-term trend and the long-term trend, it may be a signal to enter a buy trade. Conversely, when the short-term trend crosses below the medium-term trend and the long-term trend, it may be a signal to enter a sell trade.
